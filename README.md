Jour Morton

Web DesignerðŸŒˆNew York City

Hey there! I'm a graduate from the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and I'm currently participating in a Web Design fellowship program at The Knowledge House. I have a great eye for style and color and am skilled at using Adobe products like PhotoShop, Illustrator, and In-Design. I'm especially interested in 3-D imaging and broadening my understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's exhilarating to acquire new skills and challenge myself creatively! # TKH-practice-repo
